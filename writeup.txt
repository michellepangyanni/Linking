PROBLEM 7.9

Since the execution of the program involves two objects named main, the 
strong implementation in foo6.c overrides the weak definition in bar6.c. The
address printed is associated with the function main, not the char, explaining
why it printed a result when main had not yet been initialized.

Main function --> machine code instructions
We need to allocate memory for the machine code instructions.
bar6 character refer to the first byte of the function memory, thus it does have value, and the value will be printed out.

PROBLEM 7.12

A. The value of the relocated reference to swap in the callq instruction is 
?//0a000000. 
ADDR(s) = ADDR(.text) = 0x4004e0
and
ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(swap) = 0x4004f8
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
	= 0x4004e0 + 0xa
	= 0x4004ea
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr)
	= (unsigned) (0x4004f8 + (-4) - 0x4004ea)
	?//= (unsigned) (0xa)
	//= 0a000000
					
B. The value of the relocated reference to swap in the callq instruction is
22000000.
ADDR(s) = 0x4004d0
and
ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(swap) = 0x400500
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
	= 0x4004d0 + 0xa
	= 0x4004da
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) +r.addend - refaddr)
	= (unsigned) (0x400500 + (-4) - 0x4004da)
	= 22000000
