PROBLEM 7.9

Since the execution of the program involves two objects named main, the 
strong implementation in foo6.c overrides the weak definition in bar6.c. 
The address printed is associated with the function main, not the char, 
explaining why it printed a result when main had not yet been initialized. 
A certain amount of memory is allocated for the machine code instructions, 
the byte that is print out is the first byte of the function memory, so it 
has a value. 


PROBLEM 7.12

A. The value of the relocated reference to swap in the callq instruction is 0xa.

ADDR(s) = ADDR(.text) = 0x4004e0
and
ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(swap) = 0x4004f8
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
	= 0x4004e0 + 0xa
	= 0x4004ea
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr)
	= (unsigned) (0x4004f8 + (-4) - 0x4004ea)
	= (unsigned) (0xa)
    = 0xa
					
B. The value of the relocated reference to swap in the callq instruction is 
   0x22.

ADDR(s) = 0x4004d0
and
ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(swap) = 0x400500
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
	= 0x4004d0 + 0xa
	= 0x4004da
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) +r.addend - refaddr)
	= (unsigned) (0x400500 + (-4) - 0x4004da)
	= 0x22

TESTING STRATEGY

Black Box Testing
<
1. A .class file with valid magic number(of 0xCAFEBABE).
2. A .class file with invalid magic number(not of 0xCAFEBABE).
3. A .class file with a header that cannot be read because the file
quit reading early when reading through the constant pool.
4. A .class file with a header that can be read.
5. A .class file that includes a various of combination of tags to make sure 
they are printed out in the same order.
6. A .class file with an interface count that can be read.
7. A .class file with an interface count that cannot be read because the file
quit reading early when reading through the constant pool. 
8. A .class file with an attributes count that can be read.
9. A .class file with an attribute count that cannot be read because the file
quit reading early when reading through the constant pool.
10. A .class file that is truncated and contain extra bytes.
11. A .class file in which all indices into the constant pool that are followed 
while printing the dependencies and exports are invalid and the constant at 
that index is not of the expected type (according to its tag).
12. A .class file in which all indices into the constant pool that are followed 
while printing the dependencies and exports are valid and the constant at 
that index is of the expected type (according to its tag).
13. A .class file with a header than cannot be read.
14. A .class file with at least one incorrectly sized constant tag.
15. A .class file with a body that cannot be read.
16. A .class file with a different tag than index.
17. A .class file with an invalid constant_pool_count.
18. A .class file with an attribute name index that cannot be read.
19. A .class file with an attribute length that cannot be read.
20. A .class file with attribute data that cannot be read
21. An empty .class file. 
22. A .class file that does not print out all of the classâ€™ dependencies.
23. A .class file with 0, 1 or multiple methods.
24. A .class file which contains a superclass.
25. A .class file which contains an abstract class.
26. A .class file which contains a subclass.
27. A .class file which contains an interface.
28. A .class file with interface cannot be read.

TWO THINGS I LEARNED
<
1. I learned about ntohl and ntohs functions. ntohl is used to byteswap 
32-bit integers and ntohs is used to byteswap 16-bit integers.
These two functions are useful and important because different machines have
different byte ordering, and these two functions can convert the order to
big-endian format.

2. I learned a special design pattern in C from the zero length array "info" in 
jcf_cp_info. This structure allows us to allocate memory for the array by 
casting another structure to this general type or allocating 
(sizeof(struct foo) + array_len) bytes. So we iterate the constant pool array 
starting from index one.
